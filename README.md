## 🧭 About Me

I am a Senior software engineer focused on **backend systems**, **clean architecture**, and **scalable application design**.  
Alongside production-oriented development, I am actively learning data, statistics, and AI concepts through hands-on experimentation and structured projects.

I value clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability over quick hacks.

## 🏢 Organizations

I organize related work and long-running projects under dedicated GitHub organizations.

- **ml-projects**  
  Learning-oriented projects, experiments, and implementations across data, AI, and system-backed workflows.

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- **Backend-first projects** with real-world structure
- **System design experiments** and architectural explorations
- **Learning repositories** documenting progress in data and AI fundamentals
- Older projects preserved for reference and iteration

> Repositories reflect both **engineering depth** and **learning trajectory**.

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Designing robust APIs and backend workflows
- Improving system design and scalability thinking
- Building small, end-to-end projects to internalize data & AI concepts
- Strengthening fundamentals (statistics, algorithms, architecture)

---

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

- Clarity beats cleverness
- Simple systems scale better
- Learn deeply, then generalize
- Treat experimentation as a first-class engineering activity

---

## 📈 Growth Mindset

This profile is intentionally structured to show:
- Where I am **strong**
- Where I am **learning**
- How I approach long-term skill development

I optimize for **compounding knowledge**, not short-term optics.
