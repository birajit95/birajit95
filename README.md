## Software Engineer | Backend Systems | Learning AI & Data

I am a software engineer focused on building **reliable backend systems**, **scalable platforms**, and **well-structured software**. I actively explore data-driven and AI-related technologies, with an emphasis on understanding fundamentals and applying them pragmatically.

---

## Core Focus Areas

- **Backend & Systems Engineering**
  - API design and implementation
  - Asynchronous processing and real-time features
  - Database modeling and performance considerations

- **Software Engineering**
  - Clean architecture and maintainable codebases
  - Debugging, optimization, and system design
  - Version control and collaboration workflows

- **Exploring Data & AI**
  - Learning statistics, machine learning fundamentals, and AI concepts
  - Experimenting with models, data pipelines, and tooling
  - Translating theory into small, working prototypes

---

## Tech Stack

**Languages**
- Python, JavaScript

**Frameworks & Tools**
- Django, FastAPI, React
- Git, Docker, Linux

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB

**Practices**
- RESTful API design
- CI/CD basics
- Container-based development

---

## Projects

- Backend-driven applications and APIs
- System-level experiments and proof-of-concepts
- Learning-oriented repositories documenting growth and exploration

➡️ Repositories reflect both **production-style work** and **learning projects**.

---

## Engineering Mindset

- Prefer **clarity over complexity**
- Build systems that are **easy to reason about**
- Learn deeply before scaling broadly
- Treat experimentation as part of engineering growth

---

## Current Focus

- Strengthening backend and system design skills
- Deepening understanding of data, AI, and applied statistics
- Building small, end-to-end projects to validate learning
